# Menu-React

> "Menu-React" is a simple app that reads and displays the dummy data contained in a file in the form of an array of objects (this data puports to be the image, title, category, price, and description of items that are purported to be menu items). The user can either browse the entire menu or select a spacific category of menu items to browse. The category select options are hard coded in feature2-manualApproach and, on feature3-dynamicApproach are generated dynamically as more categories are written into the menu items array. The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
