# Menu-React

"Menu-React" is a simple React app that reads and displays the dummy data contained in a file in the form of an array of objects (this data puports to be the image, title, category, price, and description of menu items). The user can either browse the entire menu...

![Entire menu](/public/Menu-all.png?raw=true "Entire menu")

or select a specific category of menu items to browse. Here is the Lunch menu:

![Lunch menu](/public/Menu-shakes.png?raw=true "Lunch menu")

The category select options are hard coded in branch `f2-manual-approach` and, on branch `f3-dynamic-approach` the categories are generated dynamically as they are written into the menu items array. The app is based on the eponimous project that appears in the tutorial [Code 15 React Projects - Complete Course](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo) by freeCodeCamp.org.
